## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. **Testing - AppExchange Standards**
**Requirement:** Minimum 75% code coverage (AppExchange standard)

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ BreezyRouterControllerTest: Comprehensive coverage
- ‚úÖ BreezyRouterTest: Basic coverage
- ‚ùå Dashboard methods NOT tested: `getDashboardStats()`, `getRouterAnalytics()`, `getRoutingFrequency()`

**Actions:**
- [ ] Add test methods for dashboard functionality
- [ ] Run code coverage report
- [ ] Ensure 75%+ coverage across all classes
- [ ] Verify all public methods are tested

### 2. **Security Review - AppExchange Standards**
**Requirement:** Pass security review (no SOQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, proper access controls)

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Using bind variables in SOQL (prevents injection)
- ‚úÖ Using `with sharing` in controller
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with AuraHandledException

**Actions:**

- [ ] INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md (Installation steps for customers)
- [ ] API_DOCUMENTATION.md (Invocable method documentation)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Update existing README.md
- [ ] Create comprehensive user guide
- [ ] Document admin setup steps
- [ ] Document Flow integration (from testing guide)

### 4. **AppExchange Package Preparation**
**Package Requirements:**
- [ ] Package structure properly organized
- [ ] Version number set appropriately
- [ ] PostInstall script (if needed)
- [ ] Uninstall script (if needed)
- [ ] Package description and documentation

**Actions:**
