# BreezyRouter AppExchange App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** BreezyRouter  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Target Market:** Salesforce Administrators, Sales Operations Teams, Customer Success Teams  
**App Type:** Lightning Web Component (LWC) based management interface for round-robin user assignment

## Product Overview

BreezyRouter is a Salesforce AppExchange app that provides an intuitive Lightning Web Component interface for managing round-robin user assignment across any Salesforce object (Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Custom Objects). The app builds upon an existing Apex foundation that provides invocable methods for Flow and Apex integration.

## Current Foundation Analysis

### Existing Components
- **BreezyRouter.cls**: Core Apex class with invocable method `getNextUserInBreezyRouter`
- **BreezyRouter__c**: Custom object storing router configurations
- **BreezyRouter_Member__c**: Custom object storing user memberships with status tracking
- **Core Functionality**: Round-robin assignment based on last routed date/time

### Current Data Model
```
BreezyRouter__c
├── Name (Text) - Router identifier
└── Description__c (Text) - Router description

BreezyRouter_Member__c
├── BreezyRouter__c (Lookup to BreezyRouter__c)
├── UserId__c (Lookup to User)
├── Status__c (Picklist: Active, PTO, On Leave, Other)
├── Routed_Date__c (DateTime)
└── Routed_Time__c (Time)
```
