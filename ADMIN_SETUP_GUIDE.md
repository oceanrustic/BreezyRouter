## Security Settings

### Field-Level Security (FLS)
All custom fields respect FLS:
- Permission sets control access
- Users without access won't see fields
- Validation rules apply

### Sharing Rules
BreezyRouter uses **private sharing model**:
- Users only see routers they're members of
- Admins see all routers
- Sharing rules can be customized if needed

### Object Security
**BreezyRouter__c** (Router object):
- Read: Users with permission set
- Create/Edit: Admin or Manager permission set
- Delete: Admin permission set only

**BreezyRouter_Member__c** (Member object):
- Read: Users with permission set
- Create/Edit: Admin or Manager permission set
- Delete: Admin permission set only

### Access Control Review
1. Setup â†’ Security â†’ Sharing Settings
2. Review sharing rules
3. Verify organization-wide defaults
4. Adjust as needed for your org

---

## Customization Options

### Custom Fields
You can add custom fields to:
- **BreezyRouter__c**: Additional router metadata
- **BreezyRouter_Member__c**: Additional member information

**Important**: Custom fields won't break existing functionality.

### Validation Rules
You can create validation rules on:
- Router name format
- Member status transitions
- Other business rules

### Automation
BreezyRouter works with:
- **Flows**: Use invocable method (see [API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md))
- **Process Builder**: Call Flow with routing logic
- **Apex Triggers**: Direct Apex method calls

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review dashboard for routing patterns
- **Monthly**: Audit status changes via history
- **Quarterly**: Review and update permission set assignments
- **As needed**: Add/remove members from routers

### Data Backup
- BreezyRouter data is stored in standard Salesforce objects
- Included in regular Salesforce backups
- Can export via Data Loader if needed

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor dashboard load times
- Check for large router member lists (100+ members)
- Optimize Flow calls if processing many records

---

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

**User can't see routers:**
- âœ… Check permission set is assigned
- âœ… Verify permission set includes object access
- âœ… Check user has active status

**User can't create routers:**
- âœ… Assign **BreezyRouter Admin** or **Manager** permission set
- âœ… Verify object-level permissions

**User can't manage status:**
- âœ… Check permission set includes **BreezyRouter_Member__c** edit access
- âœ… Verify sharing rules

### Routing Issues

**Flow not routing correctly:**
- âœ… Verify router name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- âœ… Check router has active members
- âœ… Verify Flow has correct Apex action
- âœ… Check error logs in Flow debug

**Round-robin not working:**
- âœ… Verify multiple active members exist
- âœ… Check `Routed_Date__c` is being updated
- âœ… Review dashboard for routing activity

### Data Issues

**Dashboard showing incorrect counts:**
- âœ… Refresh dashboard data
- âœ… Check time range filter
- âœ… Verify data exists in org

**Status history missing:**
- âœ… Ensure field history tracking is enabled
- âœ… Check user has permission to view history
- âœ… Verify status changes were saved

## Best Practices

### Router Management
- âœ… Use descriptive names (include team/department)
- âœ… Add descriptions to document purpose
- âœ… Keep router list organized (delete unused routers)
- âœ… Regular cleanup of inactive members

### User Management
- âœ… Add users in bulk during initial setup
- âœ… Remove users when they leave team
- âœ… Update statuses proactively (before PTO, etc.)
- âœ… Use status reasons for audit trail

### Security
- âœ… Assign minimum required permission set
- âœ… Regular review of permission set assignments
- âœ… Document any customizations
- âœ… Review audit logs quarterly

### Performance
- âœ… Limit router member count to reasonable numbers (< 200 per router)
- âœ… Use filters when searching users
- âœ… Monitor dashboard load times
- âœ… Optimize Flow calls
